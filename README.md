# BHARAT_CODE
Bharat code is an IDE to enable kids in every corner of the country to code in their language.
Bharat code is an initial attempt and is still WIP. The community can particpate here in terms of XML of languages and also buttons. The code basically provides kids with 
an ability to code in their language and HTML and part of JavaScript.

###### The code is built using Tkinter for the desktop ######

###### Through this mechanism, I have also managed to create a new format of HTML cslled BHAML (Bharat Mark Up Language for Indic Languages). ######

### Browsers today don't support BHAML but the IDE generates both a .BHAML file and a .HTML file. A separate plugin on te browser can sort the BHAML extension ########

The code is divided into 3 categories

1. Bharat_Code.py, which is the main file. The main purpose of this code is to ensure how files are saved as and also how the BHAML (Bharat Mark up Language) is drawn
2. Language Factor: Which is a fatory based language class
3. Languages reside in their respective .py file
